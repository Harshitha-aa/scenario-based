//A research experiment conducted recently tried to predict the quality of
friendship between any two people based on their year of birth. Function int
friendshipQuality(int year1, int year2) takes two positive integers as
parameters and returns an integer value for friendship quality as follows:
If year1 and year2 are both leap years, then the friendship quality is equal to the
bigger of the two numbers divided by 4.
If the two passed years are both common, then the friendship quality is the
absolute value of the difference between the two, multiplied by 100.
If one of them is leap and the other is common, then the friendship quality is the
smallerof the two numbers.












#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int yr1,yr2,max,min;
    scanf("%d%d",&yr1,&yr2);
    if(yr1>yr2)
    {
        max=yr1;
        min=yr2;
    }
    else
    {
        max=yr2;
        min=yr1;
    }
    if((yr1%4==0 && yr1%100!=0) || yr1%400==0)
    {
        if((yr2%4==0 && yr2%100!=0) || yr2%400==0)
        {
            max=max%4;
            printf("%d",max);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%d",min);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d",(yr1-yr2)*100);
    }
}
